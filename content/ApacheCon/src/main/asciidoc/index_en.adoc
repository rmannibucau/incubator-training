== Introducing HerdDB

Why HerdDB ?

HerdDB started inside EmailSuccess.com as a replacement for MySQL.

EmailSuccess is a pure Java application and it is a distributed system.

.HerdDB design requirements:
* Support JDBC and be compatible with MySQL dialect.
* Run embedded in the host client Java application.
* Support high-availability.
* Support horizontal scalability.

== Design

TODO: scalability, fault tolerance etc?

== Benchmarks

TODO: compare to MySQL (potentially pg?), must include findById + findAllWithWhereClause cases IMHO

== JDBC is good but JPA is better

[%step]
* JDBC is low level
* Lot of applications using JPA for
** Simpler coding/maintenance
** Database portability
* So question is:
+
> What if HerdDB would work with JPA?

== JPA setup

> JPA uses JDBC under the hood.

...so it is trivial, right?

== JPA Challenges

[%step]
* JPA issue SQL statements. All databases are all SQL based but make it vary/enhance it
* All databases use custom types (even if some overlap)
+
> So all JPA providers abstract each database by a dialect/dictionary/platform.
* Joins must be supported
* Case must be handled
+
> All default OpenJPA dictionnaries are case insensitive for example.
* Delimiters must be handled properly
* Reserved words must be handled

== JPA statements example

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE `MyEntity` (
    `id` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, `created` TIMESTAMP, `updated` TIMESTAMP,
    `name` VARCHAR(255), `notSortable` VARCHAR(255),
    `version` BIGINT, PRIMARY KEY (`id`))
CREATE TABLE `MyEntity_tags` (`MyEntity_id` VARCHAR(255), `element` VARCHAR(255))

CREATE INDEX `I_MYNTTGS_MYENTITY_ID` 
    ON `MyEntity_tags` (`MyEntity_id`)

INSERT INTO `MyEntity` (`id`, `created`, `updated`, `name`, `notSortable`, `version`) 
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

SELECT t0.`id`, t0.`version`, t0.`created`, t0.`updated`, t0.`name`, t0.`notSortable` 
    FROM `MyEntity` t0 ORDER BY t0.`name` ASC

DELETE FROM `MyEntity_tags` WHERE `MyEntity_id` = ? 
DELETE FROM `MyEntity` WHERE `id` = ? AND `version` = ? 
----

== Custom OpenJPA dictionary

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
INFO openjpa.Runtime - Starting *OpenJPA* 3.1.3
INFO openjpa.jdbc.JDBC - Using dictionary class "*org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.sql.HerdDBDictionary*" (HerdDB  ,HerdDB 0.0).
INFO openjpa.jdbc.JDBC - Connected to *HerdDB* version 0.0 using JDBC driver HerdDB version 0.0.
----

[%step]
* Automatically detected (as any other database)
* Handled quoting
* Handled reserved keywords
* Handled case
* Handled delimiters
* Almost an Apache Calcite dictionary

== Usage challenges

[%step]
* Application often use H2/HSQLDB for fast testing roudtrips
** HerdDB must be close to keep a fluent testing workflow
* H2/HSQLDB are light
** HerdDB must stay light (in its fatjar bundle) to compete with these alternatives in embed mode

== Usage figures 1/2

[opts="header"]
|===
| Criteria               | H2        | Herdb
| Driver Size            | 2.2M      | 61K (+ netty + calcite + bookkeeper)/35M (shadowed)
| Local setup cost (ms)  | 11ms      | 1.9s
|===

NOTE: uses a minimal database to only take into account driver cost.

== Usage figures 2/2

[opts="header"]
|===
| Criteria  | H2    | Herdb
| Java 8    | 1.15s | 2.8s
| Java 11   | 1.38s | 2.7s
|===

NOTE: uses a real application database in an application using netty for the HTTP server (so classes are already loaded), still in local mode. 35 tables (max 75 columns in a table), 35 indices, 302 columns, 10 select all executed in main tables.

TIP: CDS can /2 the startup time (but not usable in tests).

== Usage figures: warning

> THIS IS ONLY ABOUT STARTUP TIME, RUNTIME IS FINE!

== JPA Conclusion

[%step]
* Herddb is trivial to setup
* Herddb can replace any database almost transparently
* Herddb can optimize your scalability in several cases
* Herddb is not yet a testing replacement of H2/HSQLDB
* Herddb is a RDBMS self-hostable (embeddable) and scalable, it is your Cloud friend
** Saves a lot of $$ compared to managed instances

== What about k8s

Challenge with Kubernetes: persistence and retention.
